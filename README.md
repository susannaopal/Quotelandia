## Abstract
My goal was to build a React app within 5 days that would allow a single user to visit the app to view the entire quote collection or to search through the quote collection by favorite author to see if that author is included in the collection. Both the full collection and the search functionality are featured to view on their own pages.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - CSS/HTML
  - React
  - VScode
  - React Router v6
  - Cypress Testing
  - [TypeFit Quotes API](https://type.fit/api/quotes)
